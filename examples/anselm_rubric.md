You are grading a philosophy assignment. Grade the student essay below
according to the rubric. For each criterion, briefly explain your assessment
and then give a score in the exact format "X/Y" (e.g. "28/35").

## Assignment Instructions

The following is what students were asked to do.

**Assignment:** Anselm's Ontological Argument (_Proslogion_, Chs. II–IV)

Students must **extract and justify** Anselm's argument. The submission must
have two parts:

**Part 1 — Extraction.** Formulate the argument in numbered premise–conclusion
form. The argument must be logically valid (all suppressed premises included).

**Part 2 — Justification.** Go premise by premise and explain why Anselm
thinks each premise is true (where it comes from in the text, what motivates
the author to accept it). Do *not* justify the conclusion.

**Part 3 — Required statement.** A brief description of how the student
completed the assignment, including whether and how any LLMs were used. This
statement does not affect the grade on its own, but its presence or absence
affects the "Clarity and Completion" criterion.

## Rubric

### 1. Reconstruction Accuracy and Structure (35 pts)

- **Excellent (30–35):** Conclusion clearly and correctly identified.
  Reconstruction captures the central steps of Anselm's reasoning. Premises
  clearly formulated and logically organized. No significant misinterpretations.
- **Good (25–29):** Conclusion mostly correct. Core structure present. Minor
  omissions or imprecisions. Overall understanding evident.
- **Developing (18–24):** Conclusion somewhat unclear or partially misstated.
  Important steps compressed or underdeveloped. Some structural confusion, but
  effort to reconstruct is visible.
- **Limited (10–17):** Significant omissions or distortions. Premises poorly
  structured or incomplete. Partial misunderstanding of Anselm.
- **Insufficient (0–9):** Major misunderstanding. No recognizable
  premise–conclusion structure.

### 2. Logical Validity (25 pts)

- **Excellent (22–25):** Premises clearly entail the conclusion. Necessary
  suppressed assumptions included. No irrelevant or implausible additions.
- **Good (19–21):** Largely valid structure. One minor suppressed premise
  unclear or implicit. Logical form mostly sound.
- **Developing (14–18):** Structure partially valid but missing at least one
  key assumption. Logical connections not fully clear.
- **Limited (7–13):** Argument invalid as written. Major suppressed premises
  missing.
- **Insufficient (0–6):** No coherent inferential structure.

### 3. Justification of the Premises (30 pts)

- **Excellent (26–30):** Each premise clearly explained. Strong grounding in
  specific ideas from Chs. II–IV. Demonstrates clear understanding of
  Anselm's reasoning. No personal evaluation introduced.
- **Good (22–25):** Most premises explained clearly. Some explanations brief
  but accurate. Clear effort to explain Anselm's point of view.
- **Developing (16–21):** Several premises insufficiently explained.
  Explanations somewhat general or summary-like. Partial confusion between
  explaining and evaluating.
- **Limited (8–15):** Minimal explanation of multiple premises. Weak textual
  grounding. Limited understanding evident.
- **Insufficient (0–7):** Little or no explanation of Anselm's reasoning.

### 4. Clarity and Completion (10 pts)

- **Full credit (10):** Clear numbered structure. Writing precise and readable.
  Under 3 pages. Required LLM statement included.
- **Strong (8–9):** Minor clarity or formatting issues. All requirements met.
- **Developing (5–7):** Noticeable clarity or formatting problems. All
  requirements met.
- **Limited (1–4):** Major clarity or formatting problems. LLM statement
  present but unclear or missing information.
- **Insufficient (0):** Missing required LLM statement and/or no recognizable
  structure.
